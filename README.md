# IoT-DDoS-Attack-Detection-using-Network-Traffic-Analysis
This project aims to detect Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks on IoT networks by analyzing network traffic patterns. The system uses machine learning to identify abnormal traffic behaviors and flag potential DDoS attacks targeting IoT devices.
